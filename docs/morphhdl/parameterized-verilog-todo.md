# Parameterized-Verilog corrective roadmap

This file is the controlling implementation checklist for the single-source
parameterized-Verilog front door. It supersedes component-by-component
recommendations in earlier increment notes when those recommendations conflict
with this roadmap.

## Roadmap discipline

- The first unchecked increment is the next increment. Work must not skip ahead
  unless this file is changed in a reviewed architecture decision.
- Parameterizable values remain typed symbolic objects through elaboration;
  they must not be replaced by their concrete defaults before symbolic RTL is
  captured.
- The production path must lower ordinary SpinalHDL component logic. A new
  component-specific ParamRTL adapter is not an acceptable substitute for that
  integration.
- Existing atomic ParamRTL nodes and their fixtures remain regression oracles
  while the generic path is built. Their presence does not establish
  single-source support.
- Upstream-owned SpinalHDL source must remain unchanged by the preservation
  increments. MorphHDL-specific files currently located under native `core`,
  `lib` or `idslplugin` source trees are also scheduled for extraction.
- If an increment cannot satisfy its contract without changing an
  upstream-owned SpinalHDL file, implementation must stop before that change.
  The exact minimal hook, alternatives and compatibility impact must be
  presented for explicit approval; no native-source exception is implicit.
- Every preservation increment must retain the applicable concrete parity,
  simulation, lint, synthesis, mutation, determinism, strict Verilog-2001 and
  dual-Scala gates already established by Increments 29 through 37.
- An increment checkbox may change from `[ ]` to `[x]` only after its
  implementation and review are complete and the full applicable local gates
  pass. Updating this checkbox is the final source change before publication.
- The suggested next increment after every completed increment must be taken
  from the first unchecked entry in this file.

The source audit and classification behind Increments 38 through 48 are
recorded in
[Native SpinalHDL source-preservation audit](native-spinal-source-preservation-audit.md).

## Corrective increments

- [x] **Increment 29 — Single-source symbolic-width bridge**

  Carry an existing typed parameter object through the ordinary SpinalHDL
  width front door. One normal component must accept a symbolic configuration
  width and use `in UInt(width bits)` to emit a public Verilog parameter and
  `[WIDTH-1:0]` port width. The same component source must provide its concrete
  default witness; it must not contain a separately authored
  `parameterizedDesign`, `moduleDef`, `packedBits`, or component-specific
  emitter. Existing concrete `SpinalVerilog` behavior remains unchanged.
  The bounded executable contract is documented in
  [Increment 29](increment-29-single-source-symbolic-width.md).

- [x] **Increment 30 — Symbolic data shapes**

  Preserve symbolic widths through `Bits`, `UInt`, `SInt`, ports, registers,
  cloning and `HardType`, then through `Bundle`, `Vec`, `Stream` and `Flow`
  payload shapes. Prove positive-width constraints over the complete declared
  parameter domain.

- [x] **Increment 31 — Generic expressions and connections**

  Lower ordinary Spinal assignments, muxes, arithmetic result widths,
  concatenation, slicing and resize without fixture-specific ParamRTL calls.
  Use the real `Stream.m2sPipe()` path as the first library-reuse proof and
  compare it with the existing Increment 28 behavioral oracle.

- [x] **Increment 32 — Hierarchy and parameter binding**

  Discover child parameter dependencies, declarations and parent bindings from
  ordinary component hierarchy. Infer compatible symbolic payload-width
  bindings from connections, retain one definition per logical component and
  reject ambiguous or inconsistent constraints.

- [x] **Increment 33 — Structural loops and generate control**

  Integrate symbolic ranges and indices with normal component construction so
  parameter-bounded instance/declaration loops lower to Verilog generate
  regions. Cover `until`, `to`, child instances, concurrent connections, Vec
  indexing and slices, then add parameter-controlled generate-if/case with
  explicit diagnostics for unsupported Scala side effects.

- [x] **Increment 34 — Generic combinational and sequential processes**

  Lower normal Spinal combinational and clocked statements instead of atomic
  mux/register nodes. Classify a safe parameter-bounded loop inside a process
  as a procedural Verilog `for`, while structural construction remains a
  generate loop, and retain driver, latch, clock and reset validation.

- [x] **Increment 35 — Native symbolic memories**

  Carry symbolic width, depth and address expressions through ordinary Spinal
  `Mem`, `readSync` and `write`. Validate capacity, enable, collision and
  out-of-range policies against the existing single-port and simple-dual-port
  memory contracts.

- [x] **Increment 36 — Native library reuse**

  Reuse ordinary Spinal `Counter`, Stream/Flow pipeline primitives and
  `StreamFifo` with symbolic payload width and initially static depth. Extend
  shared primitives or core representations where necessary; do not duplicate
  their algorithms in component-specific ParamRTL nodes.

- [x] **Increment 37 — Parameterized StreamFifo depth**

  Adapt the existing StreamFifo source path so symbolic depth controls storage,
  address width, pointers, occupancy and depth-dependent special cases while
  retaining the library algorithm and handshake semantics. Prove depths 1, 3,
  5 and 8 without regenerating or specializing the module.

## Native-source preservation increments

- [x] **Increment 38 — Native-source inventory and zero-diff guard**

  Convert the reviewed audit into a machine-readable manifest that classifies
  every current change to upstream-owned `core`, `lib` and `idslplugin` source
  as a direct edit, MorphHDL sidecar or generated/backend coupling. Add a CI
  guard that rejects any new unapproved native-source modification. Establish
  exact baseline and current hashes without changing parameterized behavior.

- [x] **Increment 39 — External elaboration and publication boundary**

  Prove that MorphHDL can invoke normal SpinalHDL elaboration, inherited
  validation, graph inspection and Verilog publication from a MorphHDL-owned
  entrypoint without patches to `Spinal.scala`, `Phase.scala`,
  `PhaseVerilog.scala` or `ComponentEmitterVerilog.scala`. Route through
  existing public plugin/configuration/phase facilities where possible. If a
  required capability is inaccessible, stop and present the precise minimal
  native hook and alternatives for approval before changing source.

- [x] **Increment 40 — External symbolic width and data-shape retention**

  Restore the native `BaseType`, `Bits`, `SInt` and `UInt` construction and
  cloning paths. Move bounded symbolic-width ownership to a MorphHDL registry
  or wrapper associated by object identity at the external elaboration
  boundary. Preserve all Increment 29 and 30 contracts through ports,
  registers, clones, `HardType`, `Bundle`, `Vec`, `Stream` and `Flow` without
  native constructor or clone hooks.

- [x] **Increment 41 — External expression, connection and hierarchy lowering**

  Move the Increment 31 and 32 expression, declaration, connection and
  hierarchy analysis behind the external MorphHDL boundary. Remove native
  emitter/phase routing changes while preserving ordinary Spinal expression
  semantics, canonical module definitions and named parameter bindings. Replace
  emitted-text assumptions with graph/AST identity wherever available and
  reject ambiguous mappings explicitly.

- [x] **Increment 42 — External structural and process capture**

  Relocate the Increment 33 and 34 structural-region and procedural-loop
  metadata/lowering from the native `core` source tree into MorphHDL-owned
  modules. Preserve ordinary driver, latch, clock, reset and hierarchy
  validation, and retain parameter-controlled generate-for/if/case and safe
  procedural-for behavior. If native AST ownership prevents an external
  implementation, apply the native-change approval gate before proceeding.

- [x] **Increment 43 — Native memory reuse with zero `Mem.scala` changes**

  Restore the ordinary `Mem` constructors and remove automatic symbolic
  attachment from native memory creation. Discover and associate symbolic
  element width, depth, address and port policies externally while keeping the
  native `Mem`, `readSync` and `write` algorithms unchanged. Preserve all
  Increment 35 capacity, enable, read-first collision, out-of-range and
  concrete-parity contracts.

- [ ] **Increment 44 — Native Counter, Stream and Flow reuse with zero library changes**

  Restore native `Counter.scala` and the Increment 36 changes in `Stream.scala`.
  Retain symbolic Counter and payload geometry externally while executing the
  unmodified Counter, `Stream.m2sPipe`, `Stream.s2mPipe`, `Stream.halfPipe`,
  `Flow.m2sPipe` and static-depth StreamFifo algorithms. Preserve their
  concrete-default parity and override tests without component-specific RTL
  reconstruction.

- [ ] **Increment 45 — Native StreamFifo parameter structure without source edits**

  Restore the Increment 37 `Stream.scala` overload and pointer edits and remove
  the `ParameterizedStreamFifoDepth` library sidecar. Retain the unmodified
  native depth-dependent alternatives and lower them generically to one
  parameterized Verilog definition, using parameter-controlled generate
  structure where required for depth one, power-of-two and non-power-of-two
  algorithms. Remove port/signal-name recognition and
  `rewriteParameterizedStreamFifoDepth`; prove depths 1, 3, 5 and 8 without a
  separately authored FIFO. Stop for architecture approval if the alternatives
  cannot be retained externally.

- [ ] **Increment 46 — MorphHDL module extraction and native-tree cleanup**

  Move remaining MorphHDL-specific parameter metadata, capture and lowering
  files out of native `core`, `lib` and `idslplugin` source trees into
  MorphHDL-owned modules/packages. Remove build coupling that requires a forked
  native implementation while retaining both Scala 2.12.18 and 2.13.12 support,
  source locations, diagnostics and public MorphHDL behavior.

- [ ] **Increment 47 — Upstream parity and complete zero-diff proof**

  Restore every upstream-owned runtime, library, emitter, phase and compiler
  plugin file identified by the audit to the selected upstream snapshot. Add an
  exact native-source manifest gate with no exception unless previously
  approved. Run the complete inherited validation inventory and all concrete,
  parameter-override, simulation, lint, synthesis, mutation and determinism
  gates for Increments 29 through 37.

- [ ] **Increment 48 — Migration and adapter retirement**

  Migrate the existing reviewed artifacts to the zero-native-edit single-source
  lowering path, preserve their simulation, lint, synthesis, mutation and
  determinism gates, and deprecate the dual-factory/component-specific
  production path. Keep the old contracts only as explicit compatibility and
  regression oracles.

## Completion target

The roadmap is complete when normal, unmodified SpinalHDL component and library
source can retain typed public parameters through MorphHDL-owned integration,
producing one readable parameterized Verilog-2001 definition per logical
component without separately handwritten ParamRTL implementations,
component-name rewrites or unapproved native-source modifications.
