# Parameterized-Verilog corrective roadmap

This file is the controlling implementation checklist for the single-source
parameterized-Verilog front door. It supersedes component-by-component
recommendations in earlier increment notes when those recommendations conflict
with this roadmap.

## Roadmap discipline

- The first unchecked increment is the next increment. Work must not skip ahead
  unless this file is changed in a reviewed architecture decision.
- Parameterizable values remain typed symbolic objects through elaboration;
  they must not be replaced by their concrete defaults before symbolic RTL is
  captured.
- The production path must lower ordinary SpinalHDL component logic. A new
  component-specific ParamRTL adapter is not an acceptable substitute for that
  integration.
- Existing atomic ParamRTL nodes and their fixtures remain regression oracles
  while the generic path is built. Their presence does not establish
  single-source support.
- An increment checkbox may change from `[ ]` to `[x]` only after its
  implementation and review are complete and the full applicable local gates
  pass. Updating this checkbox is the final source change before publication.
- The suggested next increment after every completed increment must be taken
  from the first unchecked entry in this file.

## Corrective increments

- [x] **Increment 29 — Single-source symbolic-width bridge**

  Carry an existing typed parameter object through the ordinary SpinalHDL
  width front door. One normal component must accept a symbolic configuration
  width and use `in UInt(width bits)` to emit a public Verilog parameter and
  `[WIDTH-1:0]` port width. The same component source must provide its concrete
  default witness; it must not contain a separately authored
  `parameterizedDesign`, `moduleDef`, `packedBits`, or component-specific
  emitter. Existing concrete `SpinalVerilog` behavior remains unchanged.
  The bounded executable contract is documented in
  [Increment 29](increment-29-single-source-symbolic-width.md).

- [x] **Increment 30 — Symbolic data shapes**

  Preserve symbolic widths through `Bits`, `UInt`, `SInt`, ports, registers,
  cloning and `HardType`, then through `Bundle`, `Vec`, `Stream` and `Flow`
  payload shapes. Prove positive-width constraints over the complete declared
  parameter domain.

- [x] **Increment 31 — Generic expressions and connections**

  Lower ordinary Spinal assignments, muxes, arithmetic result widths,
  concatenation, slicing and resize without fixture-specific ParamRTL calls.
  Use the real `Stream.m2sPipe()` path as the first library-reuse proof and
  compare it with the existing Increment 28 behavioral oracle.

- [x] **Increment 32 — Hierarchy and parameter binding**

  Discover child parameter dependencies, declarations and parent bindings from
  ordinary component hierarchy. Infer compatible symbolic payload-width
  bindings from connections, retain one definition per logical component and
  reject ambiguous or inconsistent constraints.

- [x] **Increment 33 — Structural loops and generate control**

  Integrate symbolic ranges and indices with normal component construction so
  parameter-bounded instance/declaration loops lower to Verilog generate
  regions. Cover `until`, `to`, child instances, concurrent connections, Vec
  indexing and slices, then add parameter-controlled generate-if/case with
  explicit diagnostics for unsupported Scala side effects.

- [x] **Increment 34 — Generic combinational and sequential processes**

  Lower normal Spinal combinational and clocked statements instead of atomic
  mux/register nodes. Classify a safe parameter-bounded loop inside a process
  as a procedural Verilog `for`, while structural construction remains a
  generate loop, and retain driver, latch, clock and reset validation.

- [x] **Increment 35 — Native symbolic memories**

  Carry symbolic width, depth and address expressions through ordinary Spinal
  `Mem`, `readSync` and `write`. Validate capacity, enable, collision and
  out-of-range policies against the existing single-port and simple-dual-port
  memory contracts.

- [ ] **Increment 36 — Native library reuse**

  Reuse ordinary Spinal `Counter`, Stream/Flow pipeline primitives and
  `StreamFifo` with symbolic payload width and initially static depth. Extend
  shared primitives or core representations where necessary; do not duplicate
  their algorithms in component-specific ParamRTL nodes.

- [ ] **Increment 37 — Parameterized StreamFifo depth**

  Adapt the existing StreamFifo source path so symbolic depth controls storage,
  address width, pointers, occupancy and depth-dependent special cases while
  retaining the library algorithm and handshake semantics. Prove depths 1, 3,
  5 and 8 without regenerating or specializing the module.

- [ ] **Increment 38 — Migration and adapter retirement**

  Migrate the existing reviewed artifacts to the single-source lowering path,
  preserve their simulation, lint, synthesis, mutation and determinism gates,
  and deprecate the dual-factory/component-specific production path. Keep the
  old contracts only as explicit compatibility and regression oracles.

## Completion target

The roadmap is complete when normal SpinalHDL component and selected library
code can retain typed public parameters through widths, hierarchy, structure
and behavior, producing one readable parameterized Verilog-2001 definition per
logical component without a separately handwritten ParamRTL implementation.
